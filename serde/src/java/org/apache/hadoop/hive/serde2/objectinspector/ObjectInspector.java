/**
 * ObjectInspector helps us to look into the internal structure of a complex
 * object.
 *
 * A (probably configured) ObjectInspector instance stands for a specific type
 * and a specific way to store the data of that type in the memory.
 *
 * For native java Object, we can directly access the internal structure through
 * member fields and methods. ObjectInspector is a way to delegate that
 * functionality away from the Object, so that we have more control on the
 * behavior of those actions.
 *
 * An efficient implementation of ObjectInspector should rely on factory, so
 * that we can make sure the same ObjectInspector only has one instance. That
 * also makes sure hashCode() and equals() methods of java.lang.Object directly
 * works for ObjectInspector as well.
