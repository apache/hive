This file contains notes tracking the licenses included in binary files.  This is not
intended to be shipped with the product but is for the use of other poor souls who
will have to figure out whether the Hive binary distribution includes all of the
necessary licenses or not.

In naming the licenses I have used the maven group id.  When there was only one jar and it was different than the
group id, I put that in the name as well.  When there were multiple jars from the same group (e.g. org.ruby has
both joni and jcoding, com.sun.jersey has a number of jars) or the jar name was the same as the group id, I named
the license just for the group id.

slf4j-LICENSE covers jul-to-slf4j jar

All of the following jars have Apache licenses and thus do not have separate license
files:

No license could be found for the following so I am optimistically assuming they are
public domain:
