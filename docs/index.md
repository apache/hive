## Getting Involved With The Apache Hive Community

Apache Hive is an open source project run by volunteers at the Apache
Software Foundation. Previously it was a subproject of [Apache&reg;
Hadoop&reg;][APACHE_HADOOP], but has now graduated to become a
top-level project of its own. We encourage you to learn about the
project and contribute your expertise.
