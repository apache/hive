Hive tracks both bugs and enhancementrequests using [Apache
JIRA]({{ site.jira }}/HIVE). We welcome input,
however, before filing a request, please make sure you do the
following:

  * Search the JIRA database.
  * Check the [user mailing list](/mailing_lists.html), both by searching the archives and by asking questions.
