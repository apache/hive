Hive MetaStore Upgrade HowTo
============================

This document describes how to upgrade the schema of a PostgreSQL backed
Hive MetaStore instance from one release version of Hive to another
release version of Hive. For example, by following the steps listed
below it is possible to upgrade a Hive 3.1.0 MetaStore schema to a
Hive 4.0.0 MetaStore schema. Before attempting this project we
strongly recommend that you read through all of the steps in this
document and familiarize yourself with the required tools.

MetaStore Upgrade Steps
=======================

1) Shutdown your MetaStore instance and restrict access to the
   MetaStore's PostgreSQL database. It is very important that no one else
   accesses or modifies the contents of database while you are
   performing the schema upgrade.

2) Create a backup of your PostgreSQL metastore database. This will allow
   you to revert any changes made during the upgrade process if
   something goes wrong. The pg_dump utility is the easiest way to
   create a backup of a PostgreSQL database:

   % pg_dump --opt <metastore_db_name> > metastore_backup.sql

   Note that you may need also need to specify a hostname and username
   using the --host and --username command line switches.

3) Dump your metastore database schema to a file. We use the pg_dump
   utility again, but this time with a command line option that
   specifies we are only interested in dumping the DDL statements
   required to create the schema:

   % pg_dump --schema-only  <metastore_db_name> > my-schema-x.y.z.postgres.sql

4) The schema upgrade scripts assume that the schema you are upgrading
   closely matches the official schema for your particular version of
   Hive. The files in this directory with names like
   "hive-schema-x.y.z.postgres.sql" contain dumps of the official schemas
   corresponding to each of the released versions of Hive. You can
   determine differences between your schema and the official schema
   by diffing the contents of the official dump with the schema dump
   you created in the previous step. Some differences are acceptable
   and will not interfere with the upgrade process, but others need to
   be resolved manually or the upgrade scripts will fail to complete.

  * Missing Tables: Hive's default configuration causes the MetaStore
    to create schema elements only when they are needed. Some tables
    may be missing from your MetaStore schema if you have not created
    the corresponding Hive catalog objects, e.g. the PARTITIONS table
    will probably not exist if you have not created any table
    partitions in your MetaStore. You MUST create these missing tables
    before running the upgrade scripts. The easiest way to do this is
    by executing the official schema DDL script against your
    schema.

  * Extra Tables: Your schema may include a table named NUCLEUS_TABLES
    or a table named SEQUENCE_TABLE. These tables are managed
    by the DataNucleus ORM layer and will be created automatically if
    they don't exist. No action on your part is required.

  * Reversed Column Constraint Names in the Same Table: Tables with
    multiple constraints may have the names of the constraints
    reversed. For example, the PARTITIONS table contains two foreign
    key constraints named PARTITIONS_FK1 and PARTITIONS_FK2 which
    reference SDS.SD_ID and TBLS.TBL_ID respectively. However, in your
    schema you may find that PARTITIONS_FK1 references TBLS.TBL_ID and
    PARTITIONS_FK2 references SDS.SD_ID. Either version is acceptable
    -- the only requirement is that these constraints actually exist.

  * Differences in Column/Constraint Names: Your schema may contain
    tables with columns named "IDX" or unique keys named
    "UNIQUE<tab_name>". If you find either of these in your schema you
    will need to change the names to "INTEGER_IDX" and
    "UNIQUE_<tab_name>" before running the upgrade scripts. For more
    background on this issue please refer to HIVE-1435.

5) You are now ready to run the schema upgrade script, make sure the db
   driver is included in the CLASSPATH,

   bin/schematool -initOrUpgradeSchema -dbType postgres \
   -driver org.postgresql.Driver -userName connect_username  \
   -url 'jdbc:postgresql://postgres_host:5432/hive' -passWord connect_password

   The command should run to completion without any errors. If you
   do encounter errors you need to analyze the cause and attempt to
   trace it back to one of the preceding steps.

6) The final step of the upgrade process is validating your freshly
   upgraded schema against the official schema for your particular
   version of Hive. This is accomplished by repeating steps (3) and
   (4), but this time comparing against the official version of the
   upgraded schema, e.g. if you upgraded the schema to Hive 4.0.0 then
   you will want to compare your schema dump against the contents of
   hive-schema-4.0.0.postgres.sql
