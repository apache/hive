Hive MetaStore Upgrade HowTo
============================

This document describes how to upgrade the schema of a SQL Server backed
Hive MetaStore instance from one release version of Hive to another
release version of Hive. For example, by following the steps listed
below it is possible to upgrade a Hive 1.2.0 MetaStore schema to a
Hive 4.0.0 MetaStore schema. Before attempting this project we
strongly recommend that you read through all of the steps in this
document and familiarize yourself with the required tools.

MetaStore Upgrade Steps
=======================

1) Take care to follow best practice for performing DB schema upgrade.
   This normally includes ensuring no one is accessing the database
   (Metastore service in particular) and backing up your database using
   tools specific to your database type.

2) Upgrade follows the usual sequence of
   upgrading from installed version to next released version, to next
   released version until the desired version is reached as specified
   in upgrade.order.mssql.

3) The schema upgrade scripts assume that the schema you are upgrading
   closely matches the official schema for your particular version of
   Hive. The files in this directory with names like
   "hive-schema-x.y.z.mssql.sql" contain dumps of the official schemas
   corresponding to each of the released versions of Hive. You can
   determine differences between your schema and the official schema
   by comparing the contents of the official dump with the schema dump
   you created in step 1. 
   
   Some differences are acceptable and will not interfere
   with the upgrade process, but others need to be resolved manually
   or the upgrade scripts will fail to complete.

  * Missing Tables: Hive's default configuration causes the MetaStore
    to create schema elements only when they are needed. Some tables
    may be missing from your MetaStore schema if you have not created
    the corresponding Hive catalog objects, e.g. the PARTITIONS table
    will probably not exist if you have not created any table
    partitions in your MetaStore. You MUST create these missing tables
    before running the upgrade scripts. The easiest way to do this is
    by executing the official schema DDL script against your
    schema. You should expect most of the DDL statements to fail since
    the table/constraint/index already exist.

  * Reversed Column Constraint Names in the Same Table: Tables with
    multiple constraints may have the names of the constraints
    reversed. For example, the PARTITIONS table contains two foreign
    key constraints named PARTITIONS_FK1 and PARTITIONS_FK2 which
    reference SDS.SD_ID and TBLS.TBL_ID respectively. However, in your
    schema you may find that PARTITIONS_FK1 references TBLS.TBL_ID and
    PARTITIONS_FK2 references SDS.SD_ID. Either version is acceptable
    -- the only requirement is that these constraints actually exist.

  * Differences in Column/Constraint Names: Your schema may contain
    tables with columns named "IDX" or unique keys named
    "UNIQUE<tab_name>". If you find either of these in your schema you
    will need to change the names to "INTEGER_IDX" and
    "UNIQUE_<tab_name>" before running the upgrade scripts. For more
    background on this issue please refer to HIVE-1435.

4) Now run the schema upgrade script, make sure the db driver is included in the CLASSPATH,

   bin/schematool -initOrUpgradeSchema -dbType mssql \
   -driver com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver  -userName connect_username \
   -url 'jdbc:sqlserver://mssql_host:1433;DatabaseName=hive' -passWord connect_password

5) Validate the results. Use DB specific tool to generate a set
   of DDL statements from your schema and compare it to
   hive-schema-a.b.c.mssql.sql.
