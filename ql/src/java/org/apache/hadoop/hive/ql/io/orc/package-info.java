/**
 * The Optimized Row Columnar (ORC) File Format.
 *
 * This format:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Decomposes complex column types into primitives</li>
 *   <li>Uses type-specific encoders for each column
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>Dictionary encodings for low cardinality columns</li>
 *       <li>Run length encoding of data</li>
 *       <li>variable length encoding of integers</li>
 *     </ul>
 *   </li>
 *   <li>Divides file into large stripes</li>
 *   <li>Each stripe includes light-weight indexes that enable the reader to
 *     skip large sets of rows that don't satisfy the filter condition</li>
 *   <li>A file footer that contains meta-information about file
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>Precise byte range for each stripe</li>
 *       <li>Type information for the file</li>
 *       <li>Any user meta-information</li>
 *     </ul>
 *   </li>
 *   <li>Seek to row number is implemented to support secondary indexes</li>
 *   <li>Support for additional generic compression: LZO, SNAPPY, ZLIB.</li>
 * </ul>
 *

 * <b>Format:</b>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * HEADER (3 bytes) "ORC"
 * STRIPE (0 or more stripes)
