 * accept arguments of complex types, and return complex types. 2. It can accept
 * variable length of arguments. 3. It can accept an infinite number of function
 * signature - for example, it's easy to write a GenericUDAF that accepts
 * array<int>, array<array<int>> and so on (arbitrary levels of nesting).
