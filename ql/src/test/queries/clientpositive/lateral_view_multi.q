-- The size of the result set is exponential and depends on the size of the array
-- and the number of lateral views: ARRAY^LATERAL.
-- For array of size 2, and 50 lateral views the result set has 2^50 elements, which is huge.
-- Without a limit clause computing and displaying the result would take forever.
