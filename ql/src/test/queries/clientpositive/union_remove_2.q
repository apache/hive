-- SORT_QUERY_RESULTS
-- This is to test the union->selectstar->filesink optimization
-- Union of 3 subqueries is performed (exactly one of which requires a map-reduce job)
-- followed by select star and a file sink.
-- There is no need to write the temporary results of the sub-queries, and then read them 
-- again to process the union. The union can be removed completely.
-- It does not matter, whether the output is merged or not. In this case, merging is turned
-- off
-- INCLUDE_HADOOP_MAJOR_VERSIONS(0.23)
-- Since this test creates sub-directories for the output table outputTbl1_n11, it might be easier
