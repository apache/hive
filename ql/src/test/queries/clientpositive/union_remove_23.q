-- SORT_QUERY_RESULTS
-- This is to test the union->selectstar->filesink optimization
-- Union of 2 map-reduce subqueries is performed followed by select star and a file sink
-- There is no need to write the temporary results of the sub-queries, and then read them 
-- again to process the union. The union can be removed completely. One of the sub-queries
-- would have multiple map-reduce jobs.
-- It does not matter, whether the output is merged or not. In this case, merging is turned
-- off
-- INCLUDE_HADOOP_MAJOR_VERSIONS(0.23)
-- Since this test creates sub-directories for the output table outputTbl1_n34, it might be easier
