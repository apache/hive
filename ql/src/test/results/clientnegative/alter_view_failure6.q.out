FAILED: SemanticException [Error 10056]: Queries against partitioned tables without a partition filter are disabled for safety reasons. If you know what you are doing, please set hive.strict.checks.no.partition.filter to false and make sure that hive.mapred.mode is not set to 'strict' to proceed. Note that you may get errors or incorrect results if you make a mistake while using some of the unsafe features. No partition predicate for Alias "default.srcpart" Table "srcpart"
