POSTHOOK: type: DESCFUNCTION
dense_rank(x) The difference between RANK and DENSE_RANK is that DENSE_RANK leaves no gaps in ranking sequence when there are ties. That is, if you were ranking a competition using DENSE_RANK and had three people tie for second place, you would say that all three were in second place and that the next person came in third.

POSTHOOK: query: DESCRIBE FUNCTION percent_rank
POSTHOOK: type: DESCFUNCTION
percent_rank(x) PERCENT_RANK is similar to CUME_DIST, but it uses rank values rather than row counts in its numerator. PERCENT_RANK of a row is calculated as: (rank of row in its partition - 1) / (number of rows in the partition - 1)

POSTHOOK: type: DESCFUNCTION
cume_dist(x) - The CUME_DIST function (defined as the inverse of percentile in some statistical books) computes the position of a specified value relative to a set of values. To compute the CUME_DIST of a value x in a set S of size N, you use the formula: CUME_DIST(x) =  number of values in S coming before    and including x in the specified order/ N
