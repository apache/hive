POSTHOOK: query: DESCRIBE FUNCTION dense_rank
POSTHOOK: type: DESCFUNCTION
dense_rank(x) The difference between RANK and DENSE_RANK is that DENSE_RANK leaves no gaps in ranking sequence when there are ties. That is, if you were ranking a competition using DENSE_RANK and had three people tie for second place, you would say that all three were in second place and that the next person came in third.
