datetime_legacy_hybrid_calendar(date/timestamp) - Converts a date/timestamp to new proleptic Gregorian calendar 
assuming that its internal days/milliseconds since epoch is calculated using legacy Gregorian-Julian hybrid calendar.
Converts a date/timestamp to new proleptic Gregorian calendar (ISO 8601 standard), which is produced 
by extending the Gregorian calendar backward to dates preceding its official introduction in 1582, assuming 
that its internal days/milliseconds since epoch is calculated using legacy Gregorian-Julian hybrid calendar, 
i.e., calendar that supports both the Julian and Gregorian calendar systems with the support of a single 
discontinuity, which corresponds by default to the Gregorian date when the Gregorian calendar was instituted.
