datetime_legacy_hybrid_calendar(date/timestamp) - Converts a date/timestamp to legacy hybrid Julian-Gregorian calendar
assuming that its internal days/milliseconds since epoch is calculated using the proleptic Gregorian calendar.
Converts a date/timestamp to legacy Gregorian-Julian hybrid calendar, i.e., calendar that supports both
the Julian and Gregorian calendar systems with the support of a single discontinuity, which corresponds by
default to the Gregorian date when the Gregorian calendar was instituted; assuming that its internal
days/milliseconds since epoch is calculated using new proleptic Gregorian calendar (ISO 8601 standard), which
is produced by extending the Gregorian calendar backward to dates preceding its official introduction in 1582.
