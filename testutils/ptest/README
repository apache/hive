= Configuration file =

Configuration file is JSON formated, example:

{
    "qfile_hosts": [
        ["hostname1", 2],
        ["hostname2", 4],
        ["hostname3", 4],
    ],
    "other_hosts": [
        ["hostname1", 2],
        ["hostname4", 5]
    ],
    "master_base_path": "${{HOME}}/hivetests",
    "host_base_path": "/mnt/drive/hivetests"
    "java_home": "/opt/jdk"
}

== qfile_hosts ==
List of hosts that should run TestCliDriver and TestNegativeCliDriver test
cases.  Number following the host name is number of simultaneous tests that
should be run on this host, you should probably set it near number of cores that
host has.

== other_hosts ==
List of hosts that should run all other test cases.  Number has the same meaning
as in `qfile_hosts`.

== master_base_path ==
Path on localhost (master) where this script can build Hive, store reports, etc.
This path should be available from every slave node and should point to the same
data (home on NFS would be a good choice).  If you specify `HIVE_PTEST_SUFFIX`
environmental variable the actual path used will be
`master_base_path-HIVE_PTEST_SUFFIX`.

== host_base_path ==
Path on slaves where Hive repo will be cloned and tests will be run.
'-your_user_name' will be actually appended to this path to allow parallel runs
by different users.  `HIVE_PTEST_SUFFIX` affects this path the same as it
affects `master_base_path`, and will be appended if needed.

== java_home ==
Should point to Java environment that should be used.

== About paths ==
You can use environmental variables with `${{my_env}}`, as home is used in the
example.

You shouldn't point this paths to your work repository or any directory that
stores data you don't want to lose.  This script might wipe everything under
`master_base_path` and `host_base_path` as needed.

== Example paths ==
Assuming your user name is 'foo' and you are using example config defined above
this will be final paths used by the script.

unset HIVE_PTEST_SUFFIX
master_base_path = /home/foo/hivetests
host_base_path = /mnt/drive/hivetests-foo

export HIVE_PTEST_SUFFIX=second_run
master_base_path = /home/foo/hivetests-second_run
host_base_path = /mnt/drive/hivetests-foo-second_run
