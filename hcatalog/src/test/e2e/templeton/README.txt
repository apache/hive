End to end tests
---------------
End to end tests in templeton runs tests against an existing templeton server.
It runs hcat, mapreduce, streaming, hive and pig tests.
This requires Hadoop cluster and Hive metastore running.

It's a good idea to look at current versions of:
https://hive.apache.org/docs/latest/webhcat/webhcat-installwebhcat
https://hive.apache.org/docs/latest/webhcat/webhcat-configure

See deployers/README.txt for help automating some of the steps in this document.

(Note that by default, webhcat-default.xml templeton.hive.properties sets
hive.metastore.uris=thrift://localhost:9933, thus WebHCat will expect
an external metastore to be running.
to start hive metastore: ./bin/hive --service metastore -p 9933)

launch templeton server: ./hcatalog/sbin/webhcat_server.sh start

to control which DB the metastore uses put something like
<property>
  <name>javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL</name>
  <value>jdbc:derby:;databaseName=/Users/ekoifman/dev/data/tmp/metastore_db_e2e;create=true</value>
  <description>Controls which DB engine metastore will use for persistence. In particular,
  where Derby will create it's data files.</description>
</property>
<property>
  <name>hive.metastore.uris</name>
  <value>thrift://localhost:9933</value>
  <description>For Hive CLI to connect to</description>
</property>

in hive-site.xml
)


!!!! NOTE !!!!
--------------
USE SVN TO CHECKOUT CODE FOR RUNNING TESTS AS THE TEST
  HARNESS IS EXTERNED FROM PIG. GIT WILL NOT IMPORT IT
  (if you are using GIT, check out http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hive/trunk (or whichever branch)
  (http://hive.apache.org/version_control.html) and symlink
  hcatalog/src/test/e2e/harness/ to corresponding harness/ in SVN tree)

Test cases
----------
The tests are defined in src/test/e2e/templeton/tests/*.conf

Test framework
--------------
The test framework is derived from the one used in pig, there is more documentation here on the framework -
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/PIG/HowToTest


Setup
-----
1. Templeton needs to be installed and setup to be able to run hcat, maprduce, hive and pig commands. 

2. Install perl and following perl modules  (cpan -i <MODULE_NAME>)
* IPC::Run
* JSON
* JSON::Path
* Data::Dump
* Number::Compare
* Text::Glob
* Data::Compare
* File::Find::Rule
* HTTP::Daemon
* Parallel::ForkManager

Tips:
* Using perlbrew (http://perlbrew.pl) should make installing perl modules easier. 
* Use 'yes | cpan -i <MODULE_NAME>' to avoid answering the 100's of questions cpan asks.



3. Copy contents of src/test/e2e/templeton/inpdir to hdfs
(e.g. ./bin/hadoop fs -put ~/dev/hive/hcatalog/src/test/e2e/templeton/inpdir/ webhcate2e)

4. You will need to copy three jars in the same HDFS directory as the contents of inpdir.  piggybank.jar, which can
be obtained from Pig and the other two are obtained from your Hadoop distribution.
For Hadoop 1.x you would need to upload hadoop-examples.jar twice to HDFS one as hclient.jar and other as hexamples.jar.
For Hadoop 2.x you would need to upload hadoop-mapreduce-client-jobclient.jar to HDFS as hclient.jar and hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar to HDFS as hexamples.jar. 
Also see https://hive.apache.org/docs/latest/webhcat/webhcat-installwebhcat/#hadoop-distributed-cache
 for notes on additional JAR files to copy to HDFS.

5. Make sure TEMPLETON_HOME environment variable is set

6. hadoop/conf/core-site.xml should have items described in
https://hive.apache.org/docs/latest/webhcat/webhcat-installwebhcat/#permissions

7. Currently Pig tar file available on http://pig.apache.org/ contains jar files compiled to work with Hadoop 1.x.
To run WebHCat tests on Hadoop 2.x you need to build your own Pig tar for Hadoop 2. To do that download the 
Pig source distribution and build it with "ant -Dforrest.home=$FORREST_HOME -Dhadoopversion=23 clean tar"
You may also need to adjust the following in Pig's build.xml as needed:
<property name="pig.version" value="0.12.1" />
<property name="pig.version.suffix" value="-SNAPSHOT" />

8. Enable webhdfs by adding the following to your hadoop hdfs-site.xml :
<property>
  <name>dfs.webhdfs.enabled</name>
  <value>true</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>dfs.http.address</name>
  <value>127.0.0.1:8085</value>
  <final>true</final>
</property>

8.Sqoop test require JDBC jar to be placed on HDFS for whichever DB the test is configured with,
for example mysql-connector-java-5.1.30-bin.jar.

**** See deployers/ for scripts that automate a lot of the set up.

Running the tests
-----------------
Use the following command to run tests -

ant test -Dinpdir.hdfs=<location of inpdir on hdfs>  -Dtest.user.name=<user the tests should run as> \
 -Dsecure.mode=<yes/no>   -Dharness.webhdfs.url=<webhdfs url upto port num>  -Dharness.templeton.url=<templeton url upto port num> 

If you want to run specific test group you can specify the group, for example:  -Dtests.to.run='-t TestHive'

If you want to run specific test in a group group you can specify the test, for example:  -Dtests.to.run='-t TestHive_1'
For example, tests/ddl.conf has several groups such as 'name' => 'REST_DDL_TABLE_BASIC'; use REST_DDL_TABLE_BASIC as the name

If you are running with Hadoop 2, please use the flag: -Dhadoopversion=23


Running the multi users tests
-----------------------------
Multi user tests comprise of Hcat authorization tests and job status tests which run commands as different users.
ant test-multi-users -Dkeytab.dir=<keytab files dir> 
  -Dsecure.mode=<yes/no>  -Dtest.group.name=<common group> -Dinpdir.hdfs=<location of inpdir on hdfs>  
  -Dtest.user.name=<user 1 belonging to common group> -Dtest.group.user.name=<user 2 belonging to common group>  
  -Dtest.other.user.name=<user 3 who does not belong to common group> 
  -Dharness.webhdfs.url=<webhdfs url upto port num>  -Dharness.templeton.url=<templeton url upto port num> 

The <keytab files dir> is expected to have keytab filenames of the form - user_name.*keytab .

Running WebHCat doas tests
--------------------------
ant clean test-doas -Dinpdir.hdfs=/user/ekoifman/webhcate2e -Dsecure.mode=no   
    -Dharness.webhdfs.url=http://localhost:8085  -Dharness.templeton.url=http://localhost:50111 
    -Dtests.to.run='-t doAsTests' -Dtest.user.name=hue -Ddoas.user=joe
    
The canonical example, is WebHCat server is running as user 'hcat', end user 'joe' is using Hue,
which generates a request to WebHCat.  If Hue specifies doAs=joe, then the commands that WebHCat
submits to Hadoop will be run as user 'joe'.

In order for this test suite to work, webhcat-site.xml should have webhcat.proxyuser.hue.groups
and webhcat.proxyuser.hue.hosts defined, i.e. 'hue' should be allowed to impersonate 'joe'.
[Of course, 'hcat' proxyuser should be configured in core-site.xml for the command to succeed.]

Furthermore, metastore side file based security should be enabled. 
(See https://hive.apache.org/docs/latest/language/languagemanual-authorization/#hive-authorization-options for more info) 

To do this 3 properties in hive-site.xml should be configured:
1) hive.security.metastore.authorization.manager set to 
    org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.security.authorization.StorageBasedAuthorizationProvider
2) hive.security.metastore.authenticator.manager set to 
    org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.security.HadoopDefaultMetastoreAuthenticator
3) hive.metastore.pre.event.listeners set to
    org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.security.authorization.AuthorizationPreEventListener
4) hive.metastore.execute.setugi set to true

Running Sqoop jobsubmission tests (This test is targeted on Sqoop1. The test will fail if using Sqoop2) 
---------------------------------
ant clean test -Dinpdir.hdfs=<location of inpdir on hdfs> -Ddb.connection.string=<jdbc connection string>
    -Ddb.user.name=<DBUserName> -Ddb.password=<DBPassWord> -Dtest.user.name=<user the tests should run as>
    -Dharness.webhdfs.url=<webhdfs url upto port num> -Dharness.templeton.url=<templeton url upto port num>
    -Dtests.to.run=-t TestSqoop

In order to run Sqoop jobsubmission tests, a RDBMS like MySQL or SQL server should be installed. Also since
Sqoop export command require table already exists in the database, a table "PERSON" need to be created under
the default database of the RDBMS installed.

Here is the schema of the table writen in MySQL:
    CREATE TABLE `world`.`person` (
    `id` INT NOT NULL,
    `name` VARCHAR(45) NULL,
    `occupation` VARCHAR(45) NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`));

To prevent primary key violation and sqoop import directory conflict, make sure the "PERSON" table is empty
and the folder hdfs://hostname:8020/sqoopoutputdir doesn't exist before running the test.

Running updateConfig tests
--------------------------
ant test-updateConfig -Dinpdir.hdfs=<location of inpdir on hdfs>  -Dtest.user.name=<user the tests should run as> \
 -Dsecure.mode=<yes/no>   -Dharness.webhdfs.url=<webhdfs url upto port num>  -Dharness.templeton.url=<templeton url upto port num>

This test suite is trying to verify the use of property templeton.mapper.memory.mb in webhcat-site.xml.
For this, an attempt is made to load data of size greater than 100MB, from one hive table to another hive table,
with the templeton.mapper.memory.mb set to a very low value. This is a negative test case that expects the failure of map job
due to insufficient memory.

For running this test suite templeton.mapper.memory.mb property should be set to 0.01 in webhcat-site.xml. This could be done by
running modify_webhcat_config.sh in deployers/. Once the test run finishes, the change could be reverted by running restore_webhcat_config.sh

Notes
-----
It's best to set HADOOP_HOME_WARN_SUPPRESS=true everywhere you can.
Also useful to add to conf/hadoop-env.sh
export HADOOP_OPTS="-Djava.security.krb5.realm=OX.AC.UK -Djava.security.krb5.kdc=kdc0.ox.ac.uk:kdc1.ox.ac.uk"
to prevent warning about SCDynamicStore which may throw some tests off
(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7134723/hadoop-on-osx-unable-to-load-realm-info-from-scdynamicstore)


Performance
-----------
It's a good idea to set fork.factor.conf.file={number of .conf files} and fork.factor.group to something > 1
(see build.xml) to make these tests run faster.  If doing this, make sure the Hadoop Cluster has 
enough map slots (10?) (mapred.tasktracker.map.tasks.maximum), otherwise test parallelism won't help.

Adding Tests
------------
ToDo: add some guidelines

Running on Tez
1. set up Tez as in http://tez.apache.org/install.html
2. set hive.execution.engine=tez in hive-site.xml (actually is this needed?)
3. add hive.execution.engine=tez to templeton.hive.properties in webhcat-site.xml
4. add to mapred-env.sh/yarn-env.sh (as you defined these in step 1)
export TEZ_VERSION=0.5.3
export TEZ_JARS=/Users/ekoifman/dev/apache-tez-client-${TEZ_VERSION}
export TEZ_CONF_DIR=${TEZ_JARS}/conf
export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=${TEZ_CONF_DIR}:${TEZ_JARS}/*:${TEZ_JARS}/lib/*:${HADOOP_CLASSPATH}
(w/o this you'll see something like "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/tez/dag/api/SessionNotRunning")
