# Note: The reason for this "forrest.properties.dispatcher.properties"
# is to assist with automated testing (main/build.sh test).
# Its content redefines the project.required.plugins property which defines
# the list of required plugins for the dispatcher.
# To test the Dispatcher in development, simply replace the 
# project.required.plugins property in the forrest.properties file by the one 
# defined in this file.
