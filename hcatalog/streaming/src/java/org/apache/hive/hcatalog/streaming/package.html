<h1>HCatalog Streaming API -- high level description</h1>

<b>NOTE: The Streaming API feature is provided as a technology
preview. The API may undergo incompatible changes in upcoming
releases.</b>

<p>
Traditionally adding new data into hive requires gathering a large
amount of data onto HDFS and then periodically adding a new
partition. This is essentially a <i>batch insertion</i>. Insertion of
new data into an existing partition or table is not done in a way that
gives consistent results to readers. Hive Streaming API allows data to
be pumped continuously into Hive. The incoming data can be
continuously committed in small batches (of records) into a Hive
partition. Once data is committed it becomes immediately visible to
all Hive queries initiated subsequently.</p>

<p>
This API is intended for streaming clients such as NiFi, Flume and Storm,
which continuously generate data. Streaming support is built on top of
ACID based insert/update support in Hive.</p>

<p>
The classes and interfaces part of the Hive streaming API are broadly
categorized into two. The first set provides support for connection
and transaction management while the second set provides I/O
support. Transactions are managed by the Hive MetaStore.  Writes are
performed to HDFS via Hive wrapper APIs that bypass MetaStore. </p>

<p>
<b>Note on packaging</b>: The APIs are defined in the 
<b>org.apache.hive.hcatalog.streaming</b> Java package and included as 
the hive-hcatalog-streaming jar.</p>

<h2>STREAMING REQUIREMENTS</h2>

<p>
A few things are currently required to use streaming.
</p>

<p>
<ol>
  <li> Currently, only ORC storage format is supported. So 
    '<b>stored as orc</b>' must be specified during table creation.</li>
  <li> The hive table may be bucketed but must not be sorted. </li>
  <li> User of the client streaming process must have the necessary 
    permissions to write to the table or partition and create partitions in
    the table.</li>
  <li> Currently, when issuing queries on streaming tables, query client must set
    <ol>
      <li><b>hive.input.format =
             org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveInputFormat</b></li>
    </ol></li>
  The above client settings are a temporary requirement and the intention is to
  drop the need for them in the near future.
  <li> Settings required in hive-site.xml for Metastore:
    <ol>
      <li><b>hive.txn.manager =
	org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.lockmgr.DbTxnManager</b></li>
      <li><b>hive.support.concurrency = true </b> </li>
      <li><b>hive.compactor.initiator.on = true</b> </li>
      <li><b>hive.compactor.worker.threads > 0 </b> </li>
    </ol></li>
</ol></p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Streaming to <b>unpartitioned</b> tables is also
supported.</p>

<h2>Transaction and Connection management</h2>

<p>
The class <a href="HiveEndPoint.html"><b>HiveEndPoint</b></a> is a Hive end
point to connect to. An endpoint is either a Hive table or
partition. An endpoint is cheap to create and does not internally hold
on to any network connections.  Invoking the newConnection method on
it creates a new connection to the Hive MetaStore for streaming
purposes.  It returns a
<a href="StreamingConnection.html"><b>StreamingConnection</b></a>
object. Multiple connections can be established on the same
endpoint. StreamingConnection can then be used to initiate new
transactions for performing I/O. </p>

<h3>Dynamic Partition Creation:</h3> It is very likely that a setup in
which data is being streamed continuously (e.g. Flume), it is
desirable to have new partitions created automatically (say on a
hourly basis). In such cases requiring the Hive admin to pre-create
the necessary partitions may not be reasonable.  Consequently the
streaming API allows streaming clients to create partitions as
needed. <b>HiveEndPoind.newConnection()</b> accepts a argument to
indicate if the partition should be auto created. Partition creation
being an atomic action, multiple clients can race to create the
partition, but only one would succeed, so streaming clients need not
synchronize when creating a partition. The user of the client process
needs to be given write permissions on the Hive table in order to
create partitions.

<h3>Batching Transactions:</h3> Transactions are implemented slightly
differently than traditional database systems. Multiple transactions
are grouped into a <i>Transaction Batch</i> and each transaction has
an id. Data from each transaction batch gets a single file on HDFS,
which eventually gets compacted with other files into a larger file
automatically for efficiency.

<h3>Basic Steps:</h3> After connection is established, a streaming
client first requests for a new batch of transactions. In response it
receives a set of transaction ids that are part of the transaction
batch. Subsequently the client proceeds to consume one transaction at
a time by initiating new transactions. Client will write() one or more
records per transactions and either commit or abort the current
transaction before switching to the next one. Each
<b>TransactionBatch.write()</b> invocation automatically associates
the I/O attempt with the current transaction id. The user of the
streaming client needs to have write permissions to the partition or
table.</p>

<p>
<b>Concurrency Note:</b> I/O can be performed on multiple
<b>TransactionBatch</b>s concurrently. However the transactions within a
transaction batch much be consumed sequentially.</p>

<h2>Writing Data</h2>

<p>
These classes and interfaces provide support for writing the data to
Hive within a transaction. 
<a href="RecordWriter.html"><b>RecordWriter</b></a> is the interface
implemented by all writers. A writer is responsible for taking a
record in the form of a <b>byte[]</b> containing data in a known
format (e.g. CSV) and writing it out in the format supported by Hive
streaming. A <b>RecordWriter</b> may reorder or drop fields from the incoming
record if necessary to map them to the corresponding columns in the
Hive Table. A streaming client will instantiate an appropriate
<b>RecordWriter</b> type and pass it to 
<b>StreamingConnection.fetchTransactionBatch()</b>.  The streaming client 
does not directly interact with the <b>RecordWriter</b> therafter, but 
relies on the <b>TransactionBatch</b> to do so.</p>

<p>
Currently, out of the box, the streaming API provides two
implementations of the <b>RecordWriter</b> interface. One handles delimited
input data (such as CSV, tab separated, etc.  and the other for JSON
(strict syntax). Support for other input formats can be provided by
additional implementations of the <b>RecordWriter</b> interface.
<ul>
<li> <a href="DelimitedInputWriter.html"><b>DelimitedInputWriter</b></a> 
- Delimited text input.</li>
<li> <a href="StrictJsonWriter.html"><b>StrictJsonWriter</b></a> 
- JSON text input.</li>
  <li> <a href="StrictRegexWriter.html"><b>StrictRegexWriter</b></a>
    - text input with regex.</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Performance, Concurrency, Etc.</h2>
<p>
  Each StreamingConnection is writing data at the rate the underlying
  FileSystem can accept it.  If that is not sufficient, multiple StreamingConnection objects can
  be created concurrently.
</p>
<p>
  Each StreamingConnection can have at most 1 outstanding TransactionBatch and each TransactionBatch
  may have at most 2 threads operaing on it.
