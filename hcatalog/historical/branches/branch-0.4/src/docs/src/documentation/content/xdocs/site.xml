Forrest site.xml

This file contains an outline of the site's information content.  It is used to:
- Generate the website menus (though these can be overridden - see docs)
- Provide semantic, location-independent aliases for internal 'site:' URIs, eg
<link href="site:changes"> links to changes.html (or ../changes.html if in
  subdir).
- Provide aliases for external URLs in the external-refs section.  Eg, <link
  href="ext:cocoon"> links to http://cocoon.apache.org/ 

See http://forrest.apache.org/docs/linking.html for more info
-->
<!-- The label attribute of the outer "site" element will only show 
  in the linkmap (linkmap.html).
  Use elements project-name and group-name in skinconfig to change name of 
  your site or project that is usually shown at the top of page.
  No matter what you configure for the href attribute, Forrest will
  always use index.html when you request http://yourHost/
  See FAQ: "How can I use a start-up-page other than index.html?"
