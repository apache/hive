Apache HCatalog is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software 
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. 

Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review 
indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process 
have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. 

While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness 
or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be 
fully endorsed by the ASF.
